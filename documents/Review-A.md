### Code Structure and Readability

1. **Break down functions** : Some functions like `send_image` are doing too many things. You could break this function down into smaller ones like `validate_image_size`, `validate_image_dimensions`, etc.
2. **Error Handling** : Consider using custom exceptions for better error management, especially when it comes to various kinds of image validation.
3. **Configurable Image Types** : Instead of hardcoding the image extensions in `get_images()`, make it configurable through environment variables or a settings file.
4. **Rate Limiting** : Instead of using `sleep` for handling rate limits, you can use a more sophisticated rate limiter.
5. **Logging** : Instead of simple text logging, you can use structured logging which can be easily parsed or sent to a monitoring system.

### Functionality

1. **Metrics** : Add metrics collection to monitor how many images are being processed, how many fail, and why.
2. **Dynamic Threading** : Instead of a fixed number of workers, consider dynamically scaling the number of threads based on the number of images to be sent.
3. **Retry Mechanism** : Implement a more sophisticated retry mechanism like a message queue for failed images, so they can be retried without manual intervention.
4. **Progress Reporting** : Implement a real-time progress report visible in the console.
5. **Concurrency** : Consider using async programming for better concurrency.
6. **Compression Settings** : Allow users to specify different compression settings like quality, file type, etc., through environment variables.

### Sample Upgrades

Here is how you could refactor the `send_image` function and add custom exceptions for better error handling:

```class ImageValidationError(Exception):
    pass

def validate_image_size(image_path: str):
    file_size = os.path.getsize(image_path)
    if file_size < MIN_FILE_SIZE or file_size > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
        raise ImageValidationError("Invalid size")

def validate_image_dimensions(image_path: str):
    with Image.open(image_path) as img:
        width, height = img.size
        if width < MIN_WIDTH or height < MIN_HEIGHT:
            raise ImageValidationError("Invalid dimensions")

def send_image(webhook_url: str, image_path: str, image_name: str) -> str:
    try:
        validate_image_size(image_path)
        validate_image_dimensions(image_path)
    except ImageValidationError as e:
        logging.info(f"Skipping {image_name} due to {str(e)}.")
        log_to_csv([image_name, 'Skipped', str(e)])
        return "skipped"
```

### Dynamic Threading

You can dynamically set the number of worker threads based on the number of images to send. For example:

`MAX_WORKERS = min(10, len(images) // 10)``  # 10 images per worker as an example

### Rate Limiter

Instead of using `sleep`, you can use a rate-limiting library like `ratelimiter` to handle rate limits more efficiently.

Install it with pip:

`pip install ratelimiter`

Here's how to use it:

```
from ratelimiter import RateLimiter

rate_limiter = RateLimiter(max_calls=10, period=1)  # 10 calls per second

@rate_limiter
def send_image():
    # Your existing send_image code
```

### Structured Logging

Structured logging can be useful when you want to analyze logs later. Libraries like `structlog` can make it easier.

Here's an example of how you might set it up:

```import structlog

structlog.configure(
    processors=[
        structlog.stdlib.filter_by_level,
        structlog.processors.TimeStamper(fmt="iso"),
        structlog.processors.JSONRenderer()
    ]
)

log = structlog.get_logger()

log.info("Image sent", image_name=image_name, status_code=response.status_code)
```

### Metrics Collection

You can collect metrics using a simple counter dictionary or use a library like Prometheus to export metrics. Here's a simple example:

```
metrics = {"sent": 0, "skipped": 0, "failed": 0}

# In your send_image function
if status == "sent":
    metrics["sent"] += 1
elif status == "skipped":
    metrics["skipped"] += 1
elif status == "failed":
    metrics["failed"] += 1

# Log or export metrics
```

### Message Queue for Retries

Instead of immediately retrying failed sends, you could put them into a message queue like RabbitMQ or use Python's `queue.Queue` for a simpler in-memory solution. This way, failed messages are not lost and can be retried efficiently.

```
from queue import Queue

failed_queue = Queue()

# If sending fails
failed_queue.put(image_path)

# Retry logic
while not failed_queue.empty():
    retry_image = failed_queue.get()
    send_image(retry_image)
```

### Real-time Progress Reporting

You could use a library like `tqdm` to show real-time progress in the console.

```
from tqdm import tqdm

for i, future in tqdm(enumerate(as_completed(futures)), total=len(futures)):
    # Your existing code
```

### Plan:

1. **Refactor Functions** : Break down the `send_image` function for better readability and maintainability.
2. **Error Handling** : Introduce custom exceptions for image validation.
3. **Configurable Image Types** : Make image extensions configurable via environment variables.
4. **Rate Limiting** : Implement sophisticated rate-limiting using the `ratelimiter` library.
5. **Logging** : Transition to structured logging using `structlog`.
6. **Metrics** : Add a metrics collection mechanism.
7. **Dynamic Threading** : Dynamically adjust the number of worker threads.
8. **Retry Mechanism** : Introduce a message queue for failed images.
9. **Real-time Progress** : Add real-time progress using the `tqdm` library.
